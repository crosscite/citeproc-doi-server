Lessons from Cambodia’s Leopard-Skin Landscape","container-title":"Brill","collection-title":"Large-Scale Land Acquisitions","abstract":"In the context of the global land rush, policy debates are split on the question of state land concessions: are smallholder-centric ‘inclusive’ investment models the only real form of responsible agricultural investment, or are ‘responsible’ concessions possible when it comes to the protection of local land access? To help move this debate forwards, this paper examines two case studies in Cambodia—an oil palm plantation recently certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and a teak plantation certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)—which we refer to as ‘better-practice’ concessions. These cases reflect efforts to operationalise the Cambodian government’s ‘Leopard-Skin’ policy, which stipulates that concessions be developed around smallholders rather than directly on top of them. We argue that regularisation is not inherently objectionable, but carries risks when carried out on a concession-by-concession basis, because it distances vulnerable land users from the potentially protective effects of the law and defers to localised, and often unequal, relations of authority. The paper thus highlights the challenges that investors and communities are likely to face even when concession developers seek to respect existing local land claims, and suggests that models based on empowered communities with more secure forms of tenure are likely to work better for all parties involved.","author":[{"family":"Michael B.

This study examines when these disputes are most likely to arise, when they will escalate into war, and when they will spread beyond the original national participants. Specifically, this article hypothesizes that the frequency of border disputes is highest between nations that have (1) roughly equal levels of power and (2) relatively low levels of technology; that the severity of these disputes is highest when there is (3) a low level of technology, (4) contention on ethnic rather than resource issues, and (5) a two-state rather than three-state \"mutually-contiguous\" set; and that the scope of these disputes is highest between nations that are (6) members of opposing blocs rather than the same bloc. Data on 66 border dispute cases during 1945-1974 confirm these hypotheses.","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/173640","ISSN":"0022-0027","author":[{"family":"Mandel","given":"Robert","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,5]]},"id":"7rz6hwecwu"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"E‐government and developing countries: an overview","container-title":"International Review of Law, Computers & Technology","page":"109-132","volume":"18","issue":"1","source":"Crossref","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13600860410001674779","DOI":"10.1080/13600860410001674779","ISSN":"1360-0869, 1364-6885","title-short":"E‐government and developing countries","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Basu","given":"Subhajit","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,17]]},"id":"ztxodnu32n"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"Statelessness in International Law: A Historic Overview","page":"7","source":"Zotero","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Stiller","given":"Martin","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"id":"rh87qk6idz"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"French Domestic Arbitration Law Special Feature","container-title":"International Lawyer (ABA)","page":"749-792","volume":"16","source":"HeinOnline","URL":"https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/intlyr16&i=763","journalAbbreviation":"Int'l L.","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Seppala","given":"Christopher R.","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1982"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,17]]},"id":"9drfi24qv3"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"The Recruitment and Training of Bureaucrats in the United States","container-title":"The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","page":"39-44","volume":"292","source":"JSTOR","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1029730","ISSN":"0002-7162","author":[{"family":"Sayre","given":"Wallace S.","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1954"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,9]]},"id":"rom4fssra4"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"Statelessness: Violation or Conduit for Violation of Human Rights?","container-title":"Human Rights Quarterly","page":"106","volume":"3","issue":"1","source":"Crossref","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/762070?origin=crossref","DOI":"10.2307/762070","ISSN":"02750392","title-short":"Statelessness","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Dorothy Jean","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1981",2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,8]]},"id":"mqn9prltxb"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"TAX PLANNING FOR CAPITAL ASSET DISPOSAL IS COMPLEX YET NECESSARY.","page":"5","source":"Zotero","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Joy","given":"David","multi":{"_key":{}}},{"family":"Vecchio","given":"Stephen C Del","multi":{"_key":{}}},{"family":"Clinton","given":"B D Ouglas","multi":{"_key":{}}},{"family":"Young","given":"James C","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"id":"ta0b9ff5bs"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"Concession Agreements: From Private Contract to Public Policy","container-title":"The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc.","abstract":"C T. Many concession agreements between governments of developing countries and corporations have failed to produce expected infrastructural, monetary, and efficiency gains. This Note argues that these agreements fail in part because the parties construct them as traditional private contracts. Given their subject matter, their noneconomic focus and purposes, and the ways in which they shape future economic development strategy, international policymakers and business leaders should conceptually and procedurally recast concession agreements as traditional matters of public policy. This reinterpretation will make the agreements more stable and successful by making their costs and benefits more transparent, their drafters more accountable to the populations they are intended to benefit, and their terms more responsive to the concerns of those populations","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20455800","author":[{"family":"Nicholas Miranda","given":"","literal":"Nicholas Miranda","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"id":"gmtdjgn91p"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"From Domestic to Global?

This article seeks to bring a different perspective to the debate, by examining selected developments in the field through the lens of the emerging global environmental law scholarship. It brings the comparative method of analysis into a multi-level context with a view to identifying the emergence of common legal responses to the problem of liability and reparation for environmental harm across different jurisdictions and regulatory levels. The analysis will focus on a ‘novel’ set of environmental liability regimes, which specifically address damage to the environment and to natural resources, as distinct from more traditional categories of damage to property and other individual rights arising as a consequence of environmental pollution. These include: the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Oil Pollution Act, which constitute a pioneering attempt to envisage a public law-oriented system of liability and restoration for damage to natural resources; the European Union Environmental Liability Directive; and selected, recent international treaty developments. The article argues that, while adopted within different legal orders and regulatory contexts, these environmental liability regimes share common features, which correspond to the ontological aspects of environmental damage and ultimately reflect a common understanding of the environment as a global public good.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/reel.12136","DOI":"10.1111/reel.12136","ISSN":"2050-0386","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Emanuela Orlando","given":"","literal":"Emanuela Orlando","multi":{"_key":{}}}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,19]]},"id":"o1ywcymis1"},{"type":"article-journal","multi":{"main":{},"_keys":{}},"title":"Blinking on the Bench: How Judges Decide Cases","container-title":"Cornell Law Review","page":"1-44","volume":"93","source":"HeinOnline","URL":"https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/clqv93&i=3","title-short":"Blinking on the Bench","journalAbbreviation":"Cornell L.
