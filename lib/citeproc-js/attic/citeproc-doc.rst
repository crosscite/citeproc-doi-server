Introduction
------------

This is the site administrator's manual for ``citeproc-js``, a
JavaScript implementation of the |link| `Citation Style Language
(CSL)`__ [#]_ The processor complies with version 1.0.1 of the CSL
specification, has been written and tested as an independent module,
and can be run by any ECMAscript-compliant interpreter. It has
deployed in browser plugins, desktop applications, and in server-side
configurations.

__ http://citationstyles.org/

This manual covers the processor command set, the expected format of
input data, and placeholder functions to be supplied by the calling
application. [#]_ In addition, notes are provided on the test suite, on
the infrastructure requirements for running the processor in
particular environments, and on extended functionality that is
available to address certain special requirements.

Comments regarding the processor and this document should be filed on
the |link| `project issue tracker`__.

.. class:: first

   .. [#] The repository is currently housed at `zotero.org`__.  Note that
          styles in the Zotero styles repository are currently at CSL version
          0.8.1.  Use the `tools provided by the CSL project`__ to convert CSL 0.8.1 
          styles to the version 1.0 syntax supported by this processor.

.. [#] For further details on required infrastructure, see the sections 
       `Locally defined system functions`_ 
       and `Data Input`_ below.

-----------------------------
Setup and System Requirements
-----------------------------

The processor is written in JavaScript, which lacks a standard I/O
method, and so must be wrapped in code for that purpose. If you get
stuck and want advice, or if you find something in this manual that is
out of date or just wrong, please feel free to post to the 
|link| `tracker`_.

.. _`tracker`: https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/issues?status=new&status=open

###################################
Getting the ``citeproc-js`` sources
###################################

The ``citeproc-js`` sources are hosted on |link| `BitBucket`__.
To obtain the sources, install the |link| `Mercurial version control system`__
on a computer within your control (if you're on a Linux distro or a Mac,
just do a package install), and run the following command:

__ http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/

__ http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/


   ::

      hg clone http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/

This should get you a copy of the sources, and you should be able to
exercise the test framework using the ``./test.py`` script.

####################################
Obtaining the Standard Test Fixtures
####################################

To run the test suite, the standard test fixtures must be added to the
processor source bundle.  To do so, enter the directory ``./tests/fixtures``,
and issue the following command:

   ::

      hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bdarcus/citeproc-test std

Note the explicit target directory "std" following the repository
address.

##########################
Obtaining the Locale Files
##########################

The processor requires a set of standard CSL 1.0 locale files in order
to run.  These may be installed using the following command
(under Linux command line). From the root of the ``citeproc-js`` source directory:

   ::

      git clone git://github.com/citation-style-language/locales.git locale



#######################
JavaScript interpreters
#######################

The processor will run in any modern ECMAscript (JavaScript)
interpreter.

To parse the XML files used to define locales and styles, the
processor relies on supplementary code, which must be loaded into the
same JavaScript context as the processor itself.  The ``xmldom.js``
and ``xmljson.js`` files shipped with the processor source serve that
purpose. The ``xmldom.js`` file is suitable for browser environments
or system that provide DOM support.  Use the ``xmljson.js`` code in
environments (such as ``node.js`` or a Firefox worker thread) where
native DOM is not available. The XML code of CSL locales and styles
can be converted to JSON on the fly using `csl-json-walker`_
(JavaScript code that relies on DOM access) or by using `makejson.py`_
(a Python script) for external pre-processing.

.. _csl-json-walker: https://github.com/fbennett/csl-json-walker/blob/master/walker.js

.. _makejson.py: https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/src/tip/tools/makejson.py?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default

For an example of working code, the source behind the 
|link| `processor demo page`__ may be useful as a reference.

__ http://gsl-nagoya-u.net/http/pub/citeproc-demo/demo.html

Instructions on running the processor test suite can be found
in the section `Running the test suite`_ at the end of this manual.



####################
Loading runtime code
####################

The primary source code of the processor is in the ``./src``
subdirectory.  Files for use in a runtime environment are catenated,
in the appropriate sequence, in the ``citeproc.js`` file, located in
the root of the source archive.  This file and the test fixtures can
be refreshed using the ``./test.py -r`` command.

To build the processor, the ``citeproc.js`` source code should be
loaded into the JavaScript interpreter context, together with a
``sys`` object provided by the integrator (see below), and the desired
CSL style (as a string).

---------------
Processor modes
---------------

The processor recognizes styles that validate under two separate
schemata, distinguished by the ``version`` attribute on the ``cs:style``
node. Styles with ``version="1.0"`` (or ``version="1.0.1"``) are assumed
to be valid under the `CSL Specification`_, and by default the processor will
adopt internal settings that produce compliant output.

.. _CSL Specification: http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html

Styles with ``version="1.1mlz1"`` are assumed to be valid under the
Juris-M Schema described in the `Juris-M (CSL-m) Specification
Supplement`_. With this version setting, internal settings of the
processor will be adapted automatically to comply with the
expectations of Juris-M.

.. _Juris-M (CSL-m) Specification Supplement: http://citationstylist.org/docs/citeproc-js-csl.html


--------------
Readable Flags
--------------

The instantiated processor has several readable flags that can be used
by the calling application to shape the user interface to the
processor.  These include the following: [#]_

######################
``opt.sort_citations``
######################

True if the style is one that sorts citations in any way.

############################
``opt.citation_number_sort``
############################

True if citations are sorted by citation
   
.. [#] Note that these are information variables intended for reading
       only; changing their value directly will have no effect on the
       actual behavior of the processor.


---------------------
Running the processor
---------------------

Instances of the processor are produced using ``CSL.Engine()`` function.
Note that, as detailed below under `Locally defined system functions`_,
certain local data access functions must be defined separately on an
object supplied to the processor as its first argument.

The instantiated processor provides a small set of runtime
configuration methods.  Instance methods are also used to load item
data into the processor, and to produce output objects suitable for
consumption by a word processor plugin, or for constructing
bibliographies.  Details of these and other methods available on
processor instances are given below.

###############################
Instantiation: ``CSL.Engine()``
###############################

The ``CSL.Engine()`` command is invoked as shown below.  The command
takes up to four arguments (two are required, two optional):

.. admonition:: Important

   See the section `Locally defined system functions`_ below for guidance
   on the definition of the functions contained in the ``sys``
   object.

.. sourcecode:: js

   var citeproc = new CSL.Engine(sys, 
                                 style, 
                                 lang,
                                 forceLang)

*sys* (object)
    A JavaScript object providing (at least) the functions
    ``retrieveLocale()`` and ``retrieveItem()``.

*style* (xml string or object)
    CSL style as serialized XML (if ``xmldom.js`` is used)
    or as JavaScript object (if ``xmljson.js`` is used).

*lang* (string, optional)
    A language tag compliant with RFC 4646.  Defaults to ``en``.
    Styles that contain a ``default-locale`` attribute value
    on the ``style`` node will ignore this option unless
    the ``forceLang`` argument is set to a non-nil value.

*forceLang* (boolean, optional)
    When set to a non-nil value, force the use of the
    locale set in the ``lang`` argument, overriding
    any language set in the ``default-locale`` attribute
    on the ``style`` node.

The version of the processor itself can be obtained
from the attribute ``processor_version``.  The supported
CSL version can be obtained from ``csl_version``.

################################
Locally defined system functions
################################

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Required ``sys`` functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two functions must be supplied to the processor upon instantiation on
the ``sys`` object.  These functions are used by the processor to
obtain locale and item data from the environment.  Their exact
definition may vary.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``retrieveLocale()``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ``retrieveLocale()`` function is used internally to retrieve the
serialized XML (or JavaScript object, if ``xmljson.js`` is used) of a
given locale.  It takes a single RFC 4646 compliant language tag as
argument, composed of a single language tag (``en``) or of a language
tag and region subtag (``en-US``).

.. sourcecode:: js

   sys.retrieveLocale = function(lang){
	   return DATA._locales[lang];
   };

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``retrieveItem()``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ``retrieveItem()`` function is used by the processor to fetch
individual items from storage. The function must be synchronous with
the processor.

.. sourcecode:: js

   sys.retrieveItem = function(id){
	   return DATA._items[id];
   };

#####################
Configuration methods
#####################

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
General configuration methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``setOutputFormat()``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The default output format of the processor is HTML. Output formats for
RTF and plain text are defined in the distribution source file
``./src/formats.js``.  Additional formats can be added if desired.
See |link| `the file itself`__ for details; it's pretty
straightforward.

__ http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/src/tip/src/formats.js

The output format of the processor can be changed to any of the
defined formats after instantiation, using the ``setOutputFormat()``
command:

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.setOutputFormat("rtf");


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``rebuildProcessorState()``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rebuilds the processor from scratch, based on a cached list of
citation objects. In a dynamic application, once the internal state of
processor is established, citations should edited with individual
invocations of ``processCitationCluster()``.

Returns an array of ``[citationID,noteIndex,string]`` triples in
document order, where ``string`` is the fully disambiguated citation
cluster for the given document position.

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.rebuildProcessorState(citations, mode, uncitedItemIDs);

**citations** (object, optional)
    An array of citation input objects in document order. Each 
    citation object must be in the following form, with correct
    values for ``citationID``, for each ``id``, and for ``noteIndex``.
    Set ``noteIndex`` to ``0`` for in-text citations.
    Default is to return an empty document update array.

    .. sourcecode:: js

       {
          "citationID": "CITATION-1",
          "citationItems": [
             {
                "id": "ITEM-1"
             }
          ],
          "properties": {
             "noteIndex": 1
          }
       }



**mode** (string, optional)
    One of ``text``, ``html`` or ``rtf``. The default is ``html``.
    After invocation, the processor is returned to its previous
    output mode setting.

**uncitedItemIDs** (array, optional)
    An array of item IDs for uncited items to be included in
    the document bibliography, if any.

Runtime function hooks
######################

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Optional ``sys`` functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``getAbbreviation()``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The optional ``getAbbreviation()`` function returns short-forms
and other transforms of field content. Its signature is as follows:

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.sys.getAbbreviation(
       styleID,
       cacheObject,
       jurisdiction,
       category,
       key,
       noHints
   );

*styleID* (required)
    A machine-readable identifier for the current style. This
    allows the function to associate abbreviation sets with
    particular styles.

*cacheObject* (object, required)
    A JavaScript object from which cached values can be obtained.
    Caching may be desired when very large abbreviation lists are
    used.

*jurisdiction* (string, required)
    Either ``default`` or, for legal resources only, a jurisdiction
    code drawn from the `LegalResourceRegistry`_.

*category* (string, required)
    The abbreviation category of the field to be matched. Categories
    and their associated variables are as follows:

    **title**
        The title category includes ``genre``, ``event``, ``medium``
        and ``title-short``, as well as ``title`` itself.

    **collection-title**
        This category includes ``archive`` in addition to
        ``collection-title``.

    **container-title**
        Only the ``container-title`` variable itself is in this category.

    **place**
        Place variables are: ``publisher-place``, ``event-place``,
        ``jurisdiction``, ``archive-place``, ``language-name``,
        ``language-name-original``.

    **institution-part**
        Institution names in Juris-M may contain multiple elements,
        separated by a pipe (aka field separator) ``|``. Individual
        elements of any institution name are in this category, which
        in Juris-M includes the ``publisher`` and ``authority`` variables.

    **institution-entire**
        The full form of Juris-M institution names is in this category.

    **number**
        All number variables. In standard CSL these are
        ``chapter-number``, ``collection-number``, ``edition``,
        ``issue``, ``number``, ``number-of-pages``,
        ``number-of-volumes``, ``volume`` and ``number``. In Juris-M,
        the following are also numbers: ``call-number``, ``page``,
        ``page-first``, ``supplement``,
        ``publication-number``. Abbreviation is attempted only when
        the variable content tests ``false`` for CSL ``is-numeric``.

*key* (string, required)
    The field content to be abbreviated.

*noHints* (boolean, required)
    The function may propose abbreviated forms for newly-encountered
    keys, using a list of words and phrases. When this toggle is set
    to ``true``, this "hinted" abbreviation is suppressed. The processor
    sets this toggle on titles and short titles of non-legal items.

##############################
Loading items to the processor
##############################


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``updateItems()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before citations or a bibliography can be generated, an ordered list
of reference items must ordinarily be loaded into the processor using
the ``updateItems()`` command, as shown below.  This command takes a
list of item IDs as its sole argument, and will reconcile the internal
state of the processor to the provided list of items, making any
necessary insertions and deletions, and making any necessary
adjustments to internal registers related to disambiguation and so
forth.

.. admonition:: Hint

   The sequence in which items are listed in the
   argument to ``updateItems()`` will ordinarily be reflected in the ordering
   of bibliographies only if the style installed in the processor
   does not impose its own sort order.

.. sourcecode:: js

   var my_ids = [
       "ID-1",
       "ID-53",
       "ID-27"
   ]
   
   citeproc.updateItems( my_ids );

To suppress sorting, give a second argument to the command
with a value of ``true``.

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.updateItems(my_ids, true);

Note that only IDs may be used to identify items.  The ID is an
arbitrary, system-dependent identifier, used by the locally customized
``retrieveItem()`` method to retrieve
actual item data.  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``updateUncitedItems()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``updateUncitedItems()`` command has the same interface
as ``updateItems()`` (including the option to suppress sorting
by the style), but the reference items it adds are
not subject to deletion when no longer referenced by a
cite anywhere in the document.


#########################
Generating bibliographies
#########################

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``makeBibliography()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``makeBibliography()`` command does what its name implies.  
If invoked without an argument,
it dumps a formatted bibliography containing all items currently
registered in the processor:

.. sourcecode:: js

   var mybib = citeproc.makeBibliography();

.. _`commands-categories`:

.. admonition:: Important
   
   Matches against the content of name and date variables
   are not possible, but empty fields can be matched for all
   variable types.  See the ``quash`` example below
   for details.

!!!!!!!!!!!!
Return value
!!!!!!!!!!!!

The value returned by this command is a two-element list, composed of
a JavaScript array containing certain formatting parameters, and a
list of strings representing bibliography entries.  It is the responsibility
of the calling application to compose the list into a finish string
for insertion into the document.  The first
element —- the array of formatting parameters —- contains the key/value
pairs shown below (the values shown are the processor defaults in the
HTML output mode):

.. sourcecode:: js

   [
      { 
         maxoffset: 0,
         entryspacing: 0,
         linespacing: 0,
         hangingindent: 0,
         second-field-align: false,
         bibstart: "<div class=\"csl-bib-body\">\n",
         bibend: "</div>",
         bibliography_errors: []
      },
      [
         "<div class=\"csl-entry\">Book A</div>",
         "<div class=\"csl-entry\">Book C</div>"
      ]
   ]

*maxoffset*
   Some citation styles apply a label (either a number or an
   alphanumeric code) to each bibliography entry, and use this label
   to cite bibliography items in the main text.  In the bibliography,
   the labels may either be hung in the margin, or they may be set
   flush to the margin, with the citations indented by a uniform
   amount to the right.  In the latter case, the amount of indentation
   needed depends on the maximum width of any label.  The
   ``maxoffset`` value gives the maximum number of characters that
   appear in any label used in the bibliography.  The client that
   controls the final rendering of the bibliography string should use
   this value to calculate and apply a suitable indentation length.

*entryspacing*
   An integer representing the spacing between entries in the bibliography.

*linespacing*
   An integer representing the spacing between the lines within
   each bibliography entry.

*hangingindent*
   The number of em-spaces to apply in hanging indents within the
   bibliography.

*second-field-align*
   When the ``second-field-align`` CSL option is set, this returns
   either "flush" or "margin".  The calling application should
   align text in bibliography output as described in the `CSL specification`__.
   Where ``second-field-align`` is not set, this return value is set to ``false``.

*bibstart*
   A string to be appended to the front of the finished bibliography
   string.
   
*bibend*
   A string to be appended to the end of the finished bibliography
   string.


__ http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#bibliography-specific-options


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Selective output
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ``makeBibliography()`` command accepts one optional argument,
which is a nested JavaScript object that may contain
*one of* the objects ``select``, ``include`` or ``exclude``, and
optionally an additional  ``quash`` object.  Each of these four objects
is an array containing one or more objects with ``field`` and ``value``
attributes, each with a simple string value (see the examples below).
The matching behavior for each of the four object types, with accompanying
input examples, is as follows:

``select``
   For each item in the bibliography, try every match object in the array against
   the item, and include the item if, and only if, *all* of the objects match.

.. admonition:: Hint

   The target field in the data items registered in the processor
   may either be a string or an array.  In the latter case,
   an array containing a value identical to the
   relevant value is treated as a match.

.. sourcecode:: js

   var myarg = {
      "select" : [
         {
            "field" : "type",
            "value" : "book"
         },
         {  "field" : "categories",
             "value" : "1990s"
         }
      ]
   }

   var mybib = cp.makeBibliography(myarg);

``include``
   Try every match object in the array against the item, and include the
   item if *any* of the objects match.

.. sourcecode:: js

   var myarg = {
      "include" : [
         {
            "field" : "type",
            "value" : "book"
         }
      ]
   }

   var mybib = cp.makeBibliography(myarg);

``exclude``
   Include the item if *none* of the objects match.

.. sourcecode:: js

   var myarg = {
      "exclude" : [
         {
            "field" : "type",
            "value" : "legal_case"
         },
         {
            "field" : "type",
            "value" : "legislation"
         }
      ]
   }

   var mybib = cp.makeBibliography(myarg);

``quash``
   Regardless of the result from ``select``, ``include`` or ``exclude``,
   skip the item if *all* of the objects match.


.. admonition:: Hint

   An empty string given as the field value will match items
   for which that field is missing or has a nil value.

.. sourcecode:: js

   var myarg = {
      "include" : [
         {
            "field" : "categories",
            "value" : "classical"
         }
      ],
      "quash" : [
         {

###################
Output of citations
###################



The available citation commands are:

* `appendCitationCluster()`_
* `processCitationCluster()`_
* `previewCitationCluster()`_

Citation commands generate strings for insertion into the text of a
target document.  Citations can be added to a document in one of two
ways: as a batch process (BibTeX, for example, works in this way) or
interactively (Endnote, Mendeley and Zotero work in this way, through
a connection to the user's word processing software).  These two modes
of operation are supported in ``citeproc-js`` by two separate
commands, respectively ``appendCitationCluster()``, and
``processCitationCluster()``.  [#]_

The ``appendCitationCluster()`` and
``processCitationCluster()`` commands use a similar input format
for citation data, which is described below in the `Data Input`_
→ `Citation data object`_ section below.

.. [#] A third, simpler command (``makeCitationCluster()``), is not
       covered by this manual.  It is primarily useful as a tool for
       testing the processor, as it lacks any facility for position
       evaluation, which is needed in production environments.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``processCitationCluster()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``processCitationCluster()`` command is used to generate and
maintain citations dynamically in the text of a document.  It takes three
arguments: a citation object, a list of citation ID/note index pairs
representing existing citations that precede the target citation, and
a similar list of pairs for citations coming after the target.  Like
the ``appendCitationCluster()`` command run without a flag, its
return value is an array of two elements: a data object, and
an array of one or more index/string pairs, one for each citation
affected by the citation edit or insertion operation.  As shown below,
the data object currently has a single boolean value, ``bibchange``,
which indicates whether the document bibliography is in need of
refreshing as a result of the ``processCitationCluster()`` operation.


.. sourcecode:: js

   var citationsPre = [ ["citation-abc",1], ["citation-def",2] ];

   var citationsPost = [ ["citation-ghi",4] ];

   citeproc.processCitationCluster(citation,citationsPre,citationsPost);

   ...

   [
      {
        "bibchange": true
      },
      [
         [ 1,"(Ronald Snoakes 1950)" ],
         [ 3,"(Richard Snoakes 1950)" ]
      ]
   ]

A worked example showing the result of multiple transactions can be
found in the |link| `processor test suite`__.

__ http://bitbucket.org/bdarcus/citeproc-test/src/tip/processor-tests/humans/integration_IbidOnInsert.txt


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``appendCitationCluster()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``appendCitationCluster()`` command takes a single citation
object as argument, and returns an array of two-element
arrays, each consisting of the current index position
as the first element, and a string for insertion into the document
as the second.  To wit:

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.appendCitationCluster(mycitation);

   [
      [ 5, "(J. Doe 2000)" ]
   ]

The command may return
multiple elements, when the processor detects that
bibliography items added by the current citation
trigger disambiguation of previously registered cites:

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.appendCitationCluster(mycitation);

   [
      [ 2, "(Jake Doe 2000)" ],
      [ 5, "(John Doe 2000)" ]
   ]


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``previewCitationCluster()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``previewCitationCluster()`` command takes the same arguments
as ``processCitationCluster()``, plus a flag to indicate the
output mode.

The return value is a string representing the
citation as it would be rendered in the specified context.  This command 
will preview citations
exactly as they will appear in the document, and will have no
effect on processor state: the next edit will return updates
as if the preview command had not been run.


.. sourcecode:: js

   var citationsPre = [ ["citation-abc",1], ["citation-def",2] ];
   var citationsPost = [ ["citation-ghi",4] ];

   citeproc.previewCitationCluster(citation,citationsPre,citationsPost,"html");

   ...

   "(Richard Snoakes 1950)"



####################################
Handling items with no rendered form
####################################

The processor might fail to produce meaningful rendered output in three
situations:

1. When `makeBibliography()`_ is run,
   and the configured style contains no ``bibliography`` node;

2. When `makeBibliography()`_ is run, and no variable other than
   ``citation-number`` produces output for an individual entry; or

3. When a `citation command`__ is used, but no element rendered for a
   particular cite produces any output.

__ `Output of citations`_

The processor handles these three cases as described below.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No ``bibliography`` node in style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the `makeBibliography()`_ command is run on a style
that has no ``bibliography`` node, the command returns
a value of ``false``.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No item output for bibliography entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the return value of the `makeBibliography()`_ command contains
entries that produce no output other than for the (automatically
generated) ``citation-number`` variable, an error object with
ID and position information on the offending entry,
and a bitwise error code (always CSL.ERROR_NO_RENDERED_FORM, currently)
is pushed to the ``bibliography_errors`` array in the data segment of the 
return object:

.. sourcecode:: js

   [
      {
         maxoffset: 0,
         entryspacing: 0,
         linespacing: 0,
         hangingindent: 0,
         second-field-align: false,
         bibstart: "<div class=\"csl-bib-body\">\n",
         bibend: "</div>",
         bibliography_errors: [
            {
               index: 2,
               itemID: "ITEM-2",
               error_code: CSL.ERROR_NO_RENDERED_FORM
            }
         ]
      },
      [
         "[1] Snoakes, Big Book (2000)",
         "[2] Doe, Bigger Book (2001)",
         "[3] ",
         "[4] Roe, Her Book (2002)"
      ]
   ]

The calling application may use the information in ``bibliography_errors``
to prompt the user concerning possible corrective action.   


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No output for citation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a citation processing command produces no output for a citation,
an error object with ID and position information on the offending
cite, and a bitwise error code (always
``CSL.ERROR_NO_RENDERED_FORM``, currently) is pushed to the 
``citation_errors`` array in the data segment of the return object.

Note that ``previewCitationCluster()`` returns only a string value,
with no data segment; citation errors are not available with this
command.

.. sourcecode:: js

   [
      {
        bibchange: true,
        citation_errors: [
           {
              citationID: "citationID_12345",
              index: 4,
              noteIndex: 3,           // for example
              itemID: "itemID_67890",
              citationItem_pos: 0,
              error_code: CSL.ERROR_NO_RENDERED_FORM
           }
        ]
      },
      [
         [ 1,"(Ronald Snoakes 1950)" ],
         [ 4,"[CSL STYLE ERROR: reference with no printed form.]" ],
         [ 5,"(Richard Snoakes 1950)" ]
      ]
   ]


----------
Data Input
----------


###########
Item fields
###########

The locally defined ``retrieveItem()`` function must return data
for the target item as a simple JavaScript array containing recognized
CSL fields. [#]_  The layout of the three field types is described below.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Text and numeric variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Text and numeric variables are not distinguished in the data layer; both
should be presented as simple strings.

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "title" : "My Anonymous Life",
      "volume" : "10"
   }

.. _clean-names:


^^^^^
Names
^^^^^

When present in the item data, CSL name variables must
be delivered as a list of JavaScript arrays, with one
array for each name represented by the variable.
Simple personal names are composed of ``family`` and ``given`` elements,
containing respectively the family and given name of the individual.

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [
       { "family" : "Doe", "given" : "Jonathan" },
       { "family" : "Roe", "given" : "Jane" }
     ],
     "editor" : [
       { "family" : "Saunders", 
         "given" : "John Bertrand de Cusance Morant" }
     ]
   }

Institutional and other names that should always be presented
literally (such as "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince",
"Banksy", or "Ramses IV") should be delivered as a single
``literal`` element in the name array:

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [
       { "literal" : "Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things" }
     ]
   }

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Names with particles
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Name particles, such as the "von" in "Werner von Braun", can
be delivered separately from the family and given name,
as ``dropping-particle`` and ``non-dropping-particle`` elements.

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [
       { "family" : "Humboldt",
         "given" : "Alexander",
         "dropping-particle" : "von"
       },
       { "family" : "Gogh",
         "given" : "Vincent",
         "non-dropping-particle" : "van"
       },
       { "family" : "Stephens",
         "given" : "James",
         "suffix" : "Jr."
       },
       { "family" : "van der Vlist",
         "given" : "Eric"
       }
     ]
   }

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Names with an articular
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Name suffixes such as the "Jr." in "Frank Bennett, Jr."  and the "III"
in "Horatio Ramses III" can be delivered as a ``suffix`` element.

.. admonition:: Hint

   A simplified format for delivering particles and name suffixes
   to the processor is described below in the section 
   `Dirty Tricks`_ → `Input data rescue`_ → `Names`__.

__ `dirty-names`_

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [
       { "family" : "Bennett",
         "given" : "Frank G.",
         "suffix" : "Jr.",
         "comma-suffix": "true"
       },
       { "family" : "Ramses",
         "given" : "Horatio",
         "suffix" : "III"
       }
     ]
   }

Note the use of the ``comma-suffix`` field in the example above.  This
hint must be included for suffixes that are preceded by a comma, which
render differently from "ordinary" suffixes in the ordinary long
form.

.. _`input-byzantine`:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"non-Byzantine" names
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Names not written in the Latin or Cyrillic 
scripts [#]_ are always displayed
with the family name first.  No special hint is needed in
the input data; the processor is sensitive to the character
set used in the name elements, and will handle such names
appropriately.

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [
       { "family" : "村上",
         "given" : "春樹"
       }
     ]
   }

.. admonition:: Hint

   When the romanized transliteration is selected from a multilingual
   name field, the ``static-ordering`` flag is not required.  See the section
   `Dirty Tricks`_ → `Multilingual content`_ below for further details.

Sometimes it might be desired to handle a Latin or Cyrillic
transliteration as if it were a fixed (non-Byzantine) name.  This
behavior can be prompted by including a ``static-ordering`` element in
the name array.  The actual value of the element is irrelevant, so
long as it returns true when tested by the JavaScript interpreter.

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [
       { "family" : "Murakami",
         "given" : "Haruki",
         "static-ordering" : 1
       }
     ]
   }


.. _`input-dates`:

^^^^^
Dates
^^^^^

Date fields are JavaScript objects, within which the "date-parts" element
is a nested JavaScript array containing a start
date and optional end date, each of which consists of a year,
an optional month and an optional day, in that order if present.

.. admonition:: Hint

   A simplified format for providing date input
   is described below in the section 
   |link| `Dirty Tricks`_ → `Input data rescue`_ → `Dates`__.

__ `dirty-dates`_

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [
            [ "2000", "1", "15" ]
         ]
      }
   }

Date elements may be expressed either as numeric strings or as
numbers.

.. sourcecode:: js
   
   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [ 
            [ 1895, 11 ]
         ]
      }
   }

The ``year`` element may be negative, but never zero.

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [ 
            [ -200 ]
         ]
      }
   }

A ``season`` element may
also be included.  If present, string or number values between ``1`` and ``4``
will be interpreted to correspond to Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, 
respectively.

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [ 
            [ 1950 ]
         ],
         "season" : "1"
      }
   }

Other string values are permitted in the ``season`` element, 
but note that these will appear in the output
as literal strings, without localization:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [
            [ 1975 ]
         ],
         "season" : "Trinity"
      }
   }

For approximate dates, a ``circa`` element should be included,
with a non-nil value:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [
            [ -225 ]
         ],
         "circa" : 1
      }
   }

To input a date range, add an array representing the end date,
with corresponding elements:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [
            [ 2000, 11 ],
            [ 2000, 12 ]
         ]
      }
   }

To specify an open-ended range, pass nil values for the end elements:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "date-parts" : [
            [ 2008, 11 ],
            [ 0, 0 ]
         ]
      }
   }



A literal string may be passed through as a ``literal`` element:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "literal" : "13th century"
      }
   }

####################
Citation data object
####################

A minimal citation data object, used as input by both the ``processCitationCluster()``
and ``appendCitationCluster()`` command, has the following form:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {
      "citationItems": [
         {
            "id": "ITEM-1"
         }
      ], 
      "properties": {
         "noteIndex": 1
      }
   }

The ``citationItems`` array is a list of one or more citation item
objects, each containing an ``id`` used to retrieve the bibliographic
details of the target resource.  A citation item object may contain
one or more additional optional values:

* ``locator``: a string identifying a page number or other pinpoint
  location or range within the resource; 
* ``label``: a label type, indicating whether the locator is to a
  page, a chapter, or other subdivision of the target resource.  Valid
  labels are defined in the |link| `CSL specification`__.
* ``suppress-author``: if true, author names will not be included in the
  citation output for this cite;
* ``author-only``: if true, only the author name will be included
  in the citation output for this cite -- this optional parameter
  provides a means for certain demanding styles that require the
  processor output to be divided between the main text and a footnote.
  (See the section `Processor control`_, in the `Dirty Tricks`_ section
  below for more details.)
* ``prefix``: a string to print before this cite item;
* ``suffix``: a string to print after this cite item.

__ http://citationstyles.org/

In the ``properties`` portion of a citation, the ``noteIndex``
value indicates the footnote number in which the citation is located
within the document.  Citations within the main text of the document
have a ``noteIndex`` of zero.

The processor will add a number of data items to a citation
during processing.  Values added at the top level of the citation
structure include:

* ``citationID``: A unique ID assigned to the citation, for
  internal use by the processor.  This ID may be assigned by the
  calling application, but it must uniquely identify the citation,
  and it must not be changed during processing or during an
  editing session.
* ``sortedItems``: This is an array of citation objects and accompanying
  bibliographic data objects, sorted as required by the configured
  style.  Calling applications should not need to access the data
  in this array directly.

Values added to individual citation item objects may include:

* ``sortkeys``: an array of sort keys used by the processor to produce
  the sorted list in ``sortedItems``.  Calling applications should not
  need to touch this array directly.
* ``position``: an integer flag that indicates whether the cite item
  should be rendered as a first reference, an immediately-following
  reference (i.e. *ibid*), an immediately-following reference with locator
  information, or a subsequent reference.
* ``first-reference-note-number``: the number of the ``noteIndex`` of
  the first reference to this resource in the document.
* ``near-note``: a boolean flag indicating whether another reference
  to this resource can be found within a specific number of notes,
  counting back from the current position.  What is "near" in
  this sense is style-dependent.
* ``unsorted``: a boolean flag indicating whether sorting imposed
  by the style should be suspended for this citation.  When true,
  cites are rendered in the order in which they are presented
  in ``citationItems``.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Runtime state: Internal objects and arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Citations are registered and accessed by the processor internally
in arrays and JavaScript objects. Data that may be of use to
calling applications can be accessed at the following locations
(note that the content of these variables should not be modified
directly; the processor will update them automatically when
citation data is processed or updated via the API):

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.registry.citationreg.citationById      // (object, returns object)

   citeproc.registry.citationreg.citationsByItemId // (object, returns array)

   citeproc.registry.citationreg.citationByIndex   // (array of objects)

   citeproc.registry.getSortedRegistryItems()      // (returns an array of 
                                                   // registry objects, with
                                                   // ``uncited`` set ``true``
                                                   // as appropriate, and
                                                   // item data on key ``ref``)

.. [#] For information on valid CSL variable names, please
          refer to the CSL specification, available via http://citationstyles.org/.

.. [#] The Latin and Cyrillic scripts are referred to here collectively
       as "Byzantine scripts", after the confluence of cultures in the first
       millenium that spanned both.

------------
Dirty Tricks
------------

This section presents features of the ``citeproc-js`` processor that
are not properly speaking a part of the CSL specification.  The
functionality described here may or may not be found in other CSL 1.0
compliant processors, when they arrive on the scene.

####################
Supplementary fields
####################

Where the calling application provides a user interface for adding and
editing bibliographic items, a limited set of fields is typically
provided for each if the item types recognized by the
application. Fields that map to valid CSL variables needed for a
particular type of reference may not be available.

If the calling application provides a mapping of the ``note`` variable
to all types, the processor can parse missing fields out of this
variable, for use in rendering citations. This facility is intended
only for testing purposes.  It provides a means of illustrating
citation use cases, with a view to requesting an adjustment to the
field lists or the user interface of the calling application.  It should
not be relied upon as a permanent workaround in production data;
and it should *never* be used to add variables that are not in the
CSL specification.

The syntax for adding supplementary fields via the ``note`` variable
is as follows:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {:authority:Superior Court of California}{:section:A}

Supplementary variables are read by the processor as flat strings, so names
and date parsing will not work with them.


#################
Input data rescue
#################

.. _dirty-names:

^^^^^
Names
^^^^^

Systems that use a simple two-field entry format can encode
``non-dropping-particle``, ``dropping-particle`` and ``suffix`` name
sub-elements by including them in the ``family`` or
``given`` name fields as illustrated below.

By default, the processor will attempt to parse such names into
their component parts. Parsing can be disabled by setting the
``parse_names`` processor configuration flag to ``false``:

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.opt.development_extensions.parse_names = false;

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``non-dropping-particle``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A string at the beginning of the ``family`` field consisting
of spaces and lowercase roman or Cyrillic characters will
be treated as a ``non-dropping-particle`` (but see `Particles as part of the last name`_ below.

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [ 
       { "family" : "van Gogh",
         "given" : "Vincent"
       }
     ]
   }



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``dropping-particle``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A string at the end of the ``given`` name field consisting
of spaces and lowercase roman or Cyrillic characters will
be treated as a ``dropping-particle``.

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [ 
       { "family" : "Humboldt",
         "given" : "Alexander von"
       }
     ]
   }

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``suffix`` (ordinary)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Content following the first comma in the ``given`` name field
will be parsed out as a name ``suffix``.

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [ 
       { "family" : "King",
         "given" : "Martin Luther, Jr."
       }, 
       { "family" : "Gates",
         "given" : "William Henry, III"
       }
     ]
   }

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``suffix`` (forced comma)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Modern typographical convention does not place a comma between
suffixes such as "Jr." and the last name, when rendering the name in
normal order: "John Doe Jr."  If an individual prefers that the
traditional comma be used in rendering their name, the comma can be
forced by placing a exclamation mark after the initial comma that
marks the beginning of the suffix:

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [ 
       { "family" : "Bennett",
         "given" : "Frank G.,! Jr."
       }
     ]
   }

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
``dropping-particle`` and ``suffix``
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As noted above, a comma in the ``given`` field marks the beginning of a suffix.
Parsing of dropping particles is limited to the portion of the ``given``
field that precedes any comma:

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [ 
       { "family" : "Moltke",
         "given" : "Helmuth von, Sr."
       }
     ]
   }

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Particles as part of the last name
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The particles preceding some names should be treated
as part of the last name, depending on the cultural
heritage and personal preferences of the individual.
To suppress parsing and treat such particles as part
of the ``family`` name field, enclose the ``family``
name field content in double-quotes:

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [

         "given" : "Eric"
       }

^^^^^
Dates
^^^^^

The ``citeproc-js`` processor contains its own internal
parsing code for raw date strings.  Clients may take advantage of the
processor's internal parser by supplying date strings as a single
``raw`` element:

.. sourcecode:: js

   {  "issued" : {
         "raw" : "25 Dec 2004"
      }
   }

Note that the parsing of raw date strings is not part of the CSL 1.0
standard.  Clients that need to interoperate with other CSL
processors should be capable of preparing input in the form described
above under `Data Input`_ → `Dates`__.

#################
Processor control
#################

In ordinary operation, the processor generates citation strings
suitable for a given position in the document.  To support some use
cases, the processor is capable of delivering special-purpose
fragments of a citation.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``author-only``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the ``makeCitationCluster()`` command (not documented here) is
invoked with a non-nil ``author-only`` element, everything but the
author name in a cite is suppressed.  The name is returned without
decorative markup (italics, superscript, and so forth).

.. sourcecode:: js

   var my_ids = { 
     ["ID-1", {"author-only": 1}]
   }

You might think that printing the author of a cited work,
without printing the cite itself, is a useless thing to do.
And if that were the end of the story, you would be right ...


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``suppress-author``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To suppress the rendering of names in a cite, include a ``suppress-author``
element with a non-nil value in the supplementary data:

.. sourcecode:: js

   var my_ids = [
       ["ID-1", { "locator": "21", "suppress-author": 1 }]
   ]

This option is useful on its own.  It can also be used in
combination with the ``author-only`` element, as described below.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Automating text insertions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calls to the ``makeCitationCluster()`` command with the ``author-only`` 
and to ``processCitationCluster()`` or ``appendCitationCluster()`` with the
``suppress-author`` control elements can be used to produce
cites that divide their content into two parts.  This permits the
support of styles such as the Chinese national standard style GB7714-87,
which requires formatting like the following:

   **The Discovery of Wetness**

   While it has long been known that rocks are dry :superscript:`[1]`  
   and that air is moist :superscript:`[2]` it has been suggested by Source [3] that 
   water is wet.

   **Bibliography**

   [1] John Noakes, *The Dryness of Rocks* (1952).

   [2] Richard Snoakes, *The Moistness of Air* (1967).

   [3] Jane Roe, *The Wetness of Water* (2000).

In an author-date style, the same passage should be rendered more or
less as follows:

   **The Discovery of Wetness**

   While it has long been known that rocks are dry (Noakes 1952)  
   and that air is moist (Snoakes 1967) it has been suggested by Roe (2000)
   that water is wet.

   **Bibliography**

   John Noakes, *The Dryness of Rocks* (1952).

   Richard Snoakes, *The Moistness of Air* (1967).

   Jane Roe, *The Wetness of Water* (2000).

In both of the example passages above, the cites to Noakes and Snoakes
can be obtained with ordinary calls to citation processing commands.  The
cite to Roe must be obtained in two parts: the first with a call
controlled by the ``author-only`` element; and the second with
a call controlled by the ``suppress-author`` element, *in that order*:

.. sourcecode:: js

   var my_ids = { 
     ["ID-3", {"author-only": 1}]
   }

   var result = citeproc.makeCitationCluster( my_ids );

... and then ...
   
.. sourcecode:: js

   var citation, result;

   citation = { 
     "citationItems": ["ID-3", {"suppress-author": 1}],
     "properties": { "noteIndex": 5 }
   }

   [data, result] = citeproc.processCitationCluster( citation );

In the first call, the processor will automatically suppress decorations (superscripting).
Also in the first call, if a numeric style is used, the processor will provide a localized 
label in lieu of the author name, and include the numeric source identifier, free of decorations.
In the second call, if a numeric style is used, the processor will suppress output, since
the numeric identifier was included in the return to the first call.

Detailed illustrations of the interaction of these two control
elements are in the processor test fixtures in the
"discretionary" category:

.. _`Multilingual content`:

#####################
Multilingual content
#####################

.. role:: sc

The version of ``citeproc-js`` described by this manual incorporates
a mechanism for supporting cross-lingual and
mixed-language citation styles, such as 我妻栄 [Wagatsuma Sakae], 
:sc:`債権各論 [Obligations in Detail]` (1969). The scheme
described below should be considered experimental for the
present. The code is intended for deployment in the
Zotero reference manager; when it is eventually accepted for deployment (possibly with
further modifications), the implementation can be considered
stable.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Selecting multilingual variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For multilingual operation, a style may be set to request alternative
versions and translations of the ``title`` field, and of the author
and other name fields.  There are two methods of setting multilingual
parameters: via ``default-locale`` (intended primarily for testing) and
via API methods (intended for production use).

When set via ``default-locale``, extensions consist of an extension tag, followed by
a language setting that conforms to |link| `RFC 5646`__ (typically constructed
from components listed in the |link| `IANA Language Subtag Registry`__).  
When set via an API method, the argument to the appropriate method should
be a list of RFC 5646 language tags.

Recognized extension
tags for use with ``default-locale`` [and corresponding API methods] are as follows:

__ http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt

__ http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry


``-x-pri-`` [``setLangTagsForCslTransliteration()``\ ]
   Sets a preferred language for transliterations.

``-x-sec-`` [``setLangTagsForCslTranslation()``\ ]
   Sets an optional secondary translation for the title field. 
   If this tag is present, a translation in the target language 
   will (if available) be placed in square braces immediately  after the title text.

``-x-sort-`` [``setLangTagsForCslSort()``\ ]
   Sets the preferred language or transliteration to be used for both the 
   title field and for names in sort keys.

An example of ``default-locale`` configuration:

.. sourcecode:: xml

   <style 
       xmlns="http://purl.org/net/xbiblio/csl"
       class="in-text"
       version="1.0"
       default-locale="en-US-x-pri-ja-Hrkt">

Multiple tags may be specified, and tags are cumulative. For
readability in test fixtures, individual tags may be separated by newlines within the
attribute.  The following will attempt to render titles in either
Pinyin transliteration (for Chinese titles) or Hepburn romanization
(for Japanese titles), sorting by the transliteration.

.. sourcecode:: xml

   <style 
       xmlns="http://purl.org/net/xbiblio/csl"
       class="in-text"
       version="1.0"
       default-locale="en-US
           -x-pri-zh-Latn-pinyin
           -x-pri-ja-Latn-hepburn
           -x-sort-zh-Latn-pinyin
           -x-sort-ja-Latn-hepburn">

An example of API configuration:

.. sourcecode:: js

   citeproc.setLangTagsForCslSort(["zh-alalc97", "ja-alalc97"]);

The processor offers three boolean API methods that are not available
via ``default-locale``:

``setOriginalCreatorNameFormsOption()``
   With argument ``true``, instructs the processor to append the 
   personal names in their original form in parentheses after transliterations.
   Default is ``false``.

``setOriginalCreatorNameFormatOption()``
   With argument ``true``, instructs the processor to use the 
   name-part ordering conventions appropriate to the original form 
   of personal names when transliterating.  When this option
   is in effect, names represented in a non-Byzantine script
   in their original form will not have their given name part
   truncated to initials, regardless of the setting provided
   by the CSL style. Default is ``false``.

``setAutoVietnameseNamesOption()``
   With argument ``true``, the processor will attempt to
   identify Vietnamese names, and format them correctly,
   with the family name always in first position. Default
   is ``false``, because there is a small possibility of
   false positives when this code is enabled.



^^^^^^^^^^^
Data format
^^^^^^^^^^^

Multilingual operation depends upon the presence of alternative
representations of field content embedded in the item data.  When
alternative field content is not availaable, the "real" field content
is used as a fallback.  As a result, configuration of language and
script selection parameters will have no effect when only a single
language is available (as will normally be the case for an ordinary
Zotero data store).


!!!!!
Title
!!!!!

For titles and other ordinary string fields, alternative representations are
placed in a separate ``multi`` segment on the item, keyed to the
field name and the language tag (note the use of the ``_keys`` element on the
``multi`` object):

.. sourcecode:: js

   { "title" : "民法",
     "multi": {
       "_keys": {
         "title": {
           "ja-alalc97": "Minpō",
           "en":"Civil Code"
         }
	   }
     }
   }

!!!!!
Names
!!!!!

For names, alternative representations are set on a ``multi``
segment of the name object itself (note the use of the ``_key``
element on the ``multi`` object):

.. admonition:: Hint

   As described above, fixed ordering is used for
   `non-Byzantine names`__.  When such
   names are transliterated, the ``static-ordering`` element is
   set on them, to preserve their original formatting behavior.

__ `input-byzantine`_



.. sourcecode:: js

   { "author" : [
       { "family" : "穂積",
         "given" : "陳重",
         "multi": {
           "_key": {
             "ja-alalc97": {
               "family" : "Hozumi",
               "given" : "Nobushige"
             }
           }
         }
       },
       { "family" : "中川",
         "given" : "善之助"
         "multi": {
           "_key": {
             "ja-alalc97": {
               "family" : "Nakagawa",
               "given" : "Zennosuke"
             }
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }


-----------
Date parser
-----------

A parser that converts human-readable dates to a structured form
is available as a self-contained module, under the name ``CSL.DateParser``.

#################################
Instantiation: ``CSL.DateParser``
#################################

When used as a standalone module, the parser must be instantiated in
the usual way before use:

.. sourcecode:: js

   var parser = new CSL.DateParser;

##############
Parser methods
##############

The following methods are available on the parser object, to control
parsing behavior and to parse string input.

``parser.parse(str)``
    Parse the string ``str`` and return a date object.
    Within the date object, the parsed date may be represented
    either as a set of key/value pairs (see ``returnAsKeys()``,
    below), or as a nested array under a ``date-parts`` key
    (see ``returnAsArray()``, below). 

``parser.returnAsArray()``
    Set the date value on the date object returned by
    the ``parse()`` method as a nested array under
    a ``date-parts`` key.  For example, the date range
    31 January 2000 to 28 February 2001 would look like
    this in array format:

    .. sourcecode:: js

       {
         "date-parts": [
           [2000, 1, 31],
           [2001, 2, 28]
         ]
       }

``parser.returnAsKeys()`` [default]
    Set the date value on the date object returned by
    the ``parse()`` method as a set of name/value pairs.
    For example, the date range 
    31 January 2000 to 28 February 2001 would look like
    this in keys format:

    .. sourcecode:: js

       {
         year: 2000, 
         month: 1,
         day: 31,
         year_end: 2001, 
         month_end: 2, 
         day_end: 28
       }

``parser.setOrderMonthDay()`` [default]
    When parsing human-readable numeric dates, assume mm/dd/yyyy ordering.

``parser.setOrderDayMonth()``
    When parsing human-readable numeric dates, assume dd/mm/yyyy ordering.

``parser.addMonths(str)``
    Extend the parser to recognize a set of 12 additional space-delimited human-readable
    text months.  The parser so extended will recognize months by their first
    three characters, unless additional characters are required to distinguish
    between different months with similar names.  To extend also by seasons,
    add four additional season names to the space-delimited list of names
    (for a list of 16 names).

``parser.resetMonths()``
    Reset month recognition to the default of ``jan feb mar apr may
    jun jul aug sep oct nov dec spr sum fal win``.

----------
Test Suite
----------

.. admonition:: Important

   Note that the standard CSL test fixtures are not distributed
   with the processor, and must be added to the source tree
   separately.

``Citeproc-js`` ships with a large bundle of test data and a set of
scripts that can be used to confirm that the system performs correctly
after installation.  The tests begin as individual human-friendly
fixtures written in a special format, shown in the sample file
immediately below.  Tests are prepared for use by grinding them into a
machine-friendly form (JSON), and by preparing an appropriate JavaScript
execution wrapper for each.  These operations are performed automatically
by the top-level test runner script that ships with the sources.


######################
Running the test suite
######################

Tests are controlled by the ``./test.py`` script in the root
directory of the archive.  To run all standard tests in the suite using
the ``rhino`` interpreted shipped with the processor, use
the following command::

    ./test.py -s

Options and arguments can be used to select an alternative
JavaScript interpreter, or  to change or limit the set of tests
run.  The script options are as follows:

``--help``: 
     List the script options with a brief description
     of each and exit
``--standard``
     Run standard tests.
``--release``
     Bundle processor, apply license to files, and test with
     bundled code.
``--cranky``
     validate style code for testing against the
     CSL schema using the ``jing`` XML tool.
``--grind``
     Force grinding of human-readable test code into machine-
     readable form.
``--styles``
     Run style tests only (style tests are not currently available)
``--processor``
     Run processor tests (cannot be used with the ``-c``, ``-g`` or ``-s``
     opts, takes only test name as single argument).
``--verbose``      
     Display test names during processing.
``--bundle-only``      
     Build the ``citeproc.js`` bundle and exit.
